            <p><i>BTS, in full<b> Bangtan Sonyeondan</b> (Korean: “Bulletproof Boy Scouts” or “Bangtan Boys”), also called Beyond the Scene, South Korean K-pop (Korean pop music) band that shot to international stardom in the late 2010s. Its seven members were<b> Jin</b> (byname of Kim Seok-Jin; b. December 4, 1992, Anyang, South Korea),<b> Suga</b> (original name Min Yoon-Gi; b. March 9, 1993, Buk-gu),<b> J-Hope</b> (byname of Jung Ho-Seok; b. February 18, 1994, Kwangju),<b> RM</b> (also called Rap Monster; original name Kim Nam-Joon; b. September 12, 1994, Ilsan),<b> Jimin </b>(byname of Park Ji-Min; b. October 13, 1995, Pusan),<b> V</b> (original name Kim Tae-Hyung; b. December 30, 1995, Taegu), and<b> Jungkook</b> (byname of Jeon Jeong-Guk; b. September 1, 1997, Pusan). BTS had a devoted following (fans called themselves ARMY [“Adorable Representative MC for Youth”]) and was popular on social media. The band broke numerous records on YouTube—namely, for the most views of a music video within 24 hours of its release, for such singles as “Boy with Luv” (2019), “Dynamite” (2020), and “Butter” (2021).</i></p>

            <p><i>BTS was formed by Bang Si-Hyuk, a successful songwriter and music producer who established his own studio, Big Hit Entertainment, in 2005. In 2010 he began to assemble talent for a group he was calling the Bangtan Sonyeondan (“Bulletproof Boy Scouts”), which would later become better known as BTS. The members—the first of whom was RM, an underground rapper in Seoul—were selected for their singing, rapping, and dancing skills. The band’s first releases were three EP (extended play) records in the School series, including 2 Cool 4 Skool (2013), O!RUL8,2? (2013), and Skool Luv Affair (2014). BTS’s first full-length album, Dark & Wild, appeared in 2014. The group wrote its own lyrics, commenting on social issues and concentrating on such themes as self-love, individuality, and empowerment. The band’s popularity grew with each recording, and, after releasing The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1 and Part 2 (both 2015), BTS began its first world tour. With momentum from the tour, Life, Part 2 rose to number one on six international music charts. The album Wings (2016) continued that success, becoming the first of the group’s albums to debut on both the Canadian Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 charts. BTS later rereleased the songs from Wings with four additional singles under the title You Never Walk Alone (2017).</i></p>    
            <p><i>At the Billboard Music Awards presentation in 2017, BTS won the Top Social Artist Award, which had been voted on by fans. The band then won the award each year through 2021, beating such performers as Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber. Meanwhile, the group released another EP, Love Yourself: Her, in 2017. The recording debuted on the Billboard 200 chart at number seven, becoming the first K-pop album to appear on the chart’s top 10. BTS’s third full-length album debuted in 2018. Titled Love Yourself: Tear, it reached the top of the Billboard 200. Love Yourself: Answer (2018) included material from both previous Love Yourself recordings along with a few new songs.</i></p>
